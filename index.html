    <textarea name="message">About Page. Mission: We're here for the future. The entire purpose of Essential Education is to improve school for the people who will be at our nation's forefront in no time: today's kids. But to get them there, we must first close the resourcing gap in public school.
      Equalize: Essential Education hears the call for help from every public school kid in the U.S. We say "NO" to continued allocation bias based on where schools are located, the tax bracket they attract, and the demographics they entail. Picture of diverse public school students playing together.
      Excite: At Essential Education, we believe school is both a privilege and a reward. Learning should be fun! As an organization, we are dedicated to providing kids everywhere, but especially in underprivileged areas, interactive opportunities from the comfort of their own districts.

      Empower: Our final, but possibly most important, mission pillar entails empowering today's youth. We want every kid that is touched by Essential Education to graduate feeling prepared for adult life. EE kids will never be alone in their journey, especially those needing more support.
